# Welcome to LevantTalk

This is our first article using the new MDX system. MDX allows us to write content in Markdown format while also supporting React components directly in our content.

## Why MDX?

- Write content in Markdown
- Use React components
- Full control over your content
- Version control through Git
- No external dependencies

## Getting Started

You can start writing your own articles by creating `.mdx` files in the `content/articles` directory. Each article should have frontmatter (the section between `---`) that includes metadata like title, type, level, and topics.
